<h1> Introduction </h1>

<p>
Hello! I'm Elias, a fledgling game and software developer with a strong passion for discovery, storytelling, and learning. As a developer, I thrive on designing systems and narratives that captivate the user's mind. What I aspire to do is lift heavy ideas and bring them to life. </p>

<p>
Aiming to merge my creativity with technical skills, creating engaging and inspiring projects is more than just a career goal - It's something deeply personal and dear to my heart. Just as I have been inspired by technology and stories, I dream of creating interesting concepts that inspire others and leave a lasting impact. </p>
  
<p>
My curiosity towards programming languages extends to regular old speaking languages, too. As a fluent speaker of both English and Finnish, I aim to participate in thought-provoking and enriching conversations using both languages. I am currently delving into Swedish, hoping to add it to my repertoire. Delving into its nuances helps me connect with a larger community as well as deepens my appreciation for complex languages themselves. </p>

<h1> Education </h1>
<p> 
Currently enrolled as a Second Year student at Metropolia University of Applied Sciences, studying Information and Communication technology. During my stay at Metropolia, I have been given countless opportunities to create & bring to life fascinating concepts, be it in code, writing or conceptual design. 
</p>
<p>
Honorably completed courses in both Math and Physics,  demonstrating an understanding of the foundations and principles that support logical thinking as well as problem-solving - Both vital skills that I have learned to apply to my programming work.
